// If we want to Search Box Behaviour :

1. Search Box sends a request to Backend Server to fetch the results 

2. What we need : 
    1.API URL (The Endpoint) that search box calls
    2.HTTP Method (GET AND POST)
    3.The parameters (like search keywords) that request sends

3.Creation of .feature file (GET METHOD)
    Feature: Test search box functionality

  Scenario: Search for a term and verify results
    Given url 'https://xyz.com'
    And param query = 'pratham'      # The query parameter for the search term
    When method GET               # If your search uses a GET method
    Then status 200               # Ensure the request is successful
    And match response.results.length > 0    # Verify that results are returned
    And match response.results[0].title contains 'pratham'  # Check that the first result contains the search term

4.Creation of .feature file (POST METHOD)
    Feature: Test search box functionality

  Scenario: Search for 'laptop' using a POST request
    Given url 'https://your-app-backend.com/search'
    And request { "searchTerm": "Pratham" }  # Sending the search term in the request body
    When method POST
    Then status 200
    And match response.results.length > 0
    And match response.results[0].title contains 'Pratham'
